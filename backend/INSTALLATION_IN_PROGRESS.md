# ⏳ Installation in Progress

## What's Happening

I've started the Composer dependency installation in a separate window. This process:

- **Takes 5-10 minutes** to download and install all packages
- **Downloads ~100 packages** (Laravel framework and dependencies)
- **Requires internet connection**
- **Must complete without interruption**

## What to Do

1. **Check the Composer window** that just opened
2. **Wait for it to finish** - you'll see "Writing lock file" and "Generating autoload files" when done
3. **Don't close the window** until it's complete

## After Installation Completes

Once the installation finishes, I'll continue with:
- ✅ Generate application key
- ✅ Create .env file  
- ✅ Run database migrations
- ✅ Seed database with default users

## If Installation Fails

If you see any errors, let me know and I'll help fix them.
